# UA-ECE480
This project is an assignment for a Digital Systems Design class to design a version of the 'Snake Game' using Vivado with the Basys3 FPGA board. 
I do not take credit for the Basys3_Master, simple_vga, or vga_sync files. These were given to start the project and only slight modifications were made.
Simple_vga is the controller while vga_syn sets up the display with horizontal and vertical syncs.
Operational_snake_head displays a snake that responds to buttons and stops the game at the wall.
